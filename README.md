# Training-Team-Tracker
An android app to manage trainings between a coach and his team members.


## Some important things that need to be fixed before coding menus interfaces:
- [ ] Enforcing unique usernames in firebase, How?? [Here is a solution](https://bigcodenerd.org/enforce-cloud-firestore-unique-field-values/)
- [ ] Handle editing email by updating it on the document, deleting and creating a new user in firebase auth with that email
- [ ] Coach username can't be changed (it's the key to allow a member join a team)
- [ ] Add more & more users , test the app on multiple devices with the different accounts (Coachs & Members)
